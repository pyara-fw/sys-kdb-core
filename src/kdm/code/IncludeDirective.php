 * statement in Cobol, the #include directive in the C language). The include
 * directive is usually related to a SharedUnit (for example, a copybook in Cobol,
 * or a header file in C). A block of “included” code elements, which are the
 * clones of the elements owned by the SharedUnit may be associated with the
 * include directive.
